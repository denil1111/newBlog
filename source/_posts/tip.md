when we try to type up,down,left,right in python3~,it doesn't work,so what how to deal with it~?
	
## just

	easy_install readline
	
if you doesn't get the easy_install,you should install it

	sudo curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python3

it will be python or python3~,depends on your config
