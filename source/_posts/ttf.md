today, I changed my logo's font and location, well, Dose my blog look better? But when i try to view it on my PC(use ie), the font become invalid, when I use the F12, the console tells me 


	
	CSS3114: @font-face failed OpenType embedding permission check

It troubled me A LOT!Finally I found the solution ..... IE10 or 11 dosen't support ttf well, so I convert the ttf file to woff file. All right ! It perform good now!
